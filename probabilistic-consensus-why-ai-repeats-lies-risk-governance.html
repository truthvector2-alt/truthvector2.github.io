          <p class="fine">
            The governance question is not whether AI can be wrong. The governance question is whether the organization can demonstrate control: provenance, accountability, monitoring, and auditable remediation when wrong outputs persist.
          </p>

      <h2>Section 1: The Thesis</h2>
      <p>
        Probabilistic consensus produces a particular governance hazard: it fabricates stability. The false claim recurs across models and sessions, often with citations that appear diverse but are actually derivative. This pushes the error from “model behavior” into “operational environment.” Once the claim is stable, the organization’s exposure is no longer about an isolated answer. It becomes about reliance: employees, customers, partners, and third parties treat the repeated claim as established fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        A governance program that treats this as a messaging issue is structurally incompetent. The correct lens is control effectiveness. Can the organization identify the claim, trace the provenance chain that made it recurrent, and demonstrate that remediation actions reduced recurrence across representative prompts and channels? If not, the organization cannot credibly claim oversight, and it cannot reliably bound harm.
      </p>

      <div class="rulebox">
        Non-promissory governance statement: The existence of controls does not guarantee elimination of false outputs. The governance objective is traceable reduction, auditable decision-making, and documented residual risk.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="core-analysis">
      <h2>Section 2: The Core Analysis (Governance)</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Why This Failure Mode Is Governance-Critical</h3>
      <p>
        Probabilistic consensus collapses the difference between “popular” and “true.” In a purely technical view, it is a statistical artifact. In a governance view, it is a control breakdown: the system lacks adequate mechanisms to preserve epistemic boundaries under repetition pressure. The governance failure is compounded by the system’s confidence style. Fluent prose is an authority mimic. As a result, repeated errors can appear more reliable than cautious truth.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Accountability Assignment: Model Vendor vs. Deployer vs. Publisher</h3>
      <p>
        Governance requires explicit role allocation. In real deployments, responsibility is distributed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Model provider:</strong> base-model limitations, safety policies, known failure modes, and update cadence.</li>
        <li><strong>System integrator:</strong> retrieval configuration, ranking logic, source allowlists/denylists, and caching behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Operator/deployer:</strong> monitoring, incident response, user guidance, and access control for high-impact use cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Content publisher ecosystem:</strong the web graph that supplies repeated claims and derivative citations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A mature program documents boundaries. It does not treat “the vendor’s model did it” as a usable defense if the organization deploys the output in a consequential setting without verification controls.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Control Objective: Provenance Over Plausibility</h3>
      <p>
        Governance controls for probabilistic consensus must prioritize provenance. “Multiple sources” is not meaningful if those sources are copies. The control objective is to ensure that critical claims are traceable to primary or authoritative references, and that derivative repetition is not misinterpreted as independent confirmation.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Required Documentation: What Auditors Ask For</h3>
      <p>
        In a dispute or audit, the organization is asked to show evidence of oversight. The baseline artifacts include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A claim register: defined false propositions, classification, severity, and impacted entities.</li>
        <li>A provenance map: origin candidates, syndication nodes, and high-influence retrieval sources.</li>
        <li>A retrieval test suite: representative prompts, timestamps, returned documents, and observed outputs.</li>
        <li>A remediation log: actions taken, where applied, and what was expected to change.</li>
        <li>A monitoring plan: cadence, thresholds, and escalation paths for recurrence.</li>
        <li>A residual risk statement: what cannot be controlled and how users are protected from reliance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Absence of these artifacts is interpreted as absence of governance, regardless of whether informal efforts were attempted.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5 Governance Failure Patterns That Produce Recurrence</h3>
      <p>
        Probabilistic consensus persists when organizations implement controls that are symbolic rather than functional. Common failure patterns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Output-only remediation:</strong correcting a single page or single snippet while the propagation ecosystem remains intact.</li>
        <li><strong>No prompt discipline:</strong no standardized prompt set, making “improvement” unmeasurable and non-repeatable.</li>
        <li><strong>No source classification:</strong treating press releases, scrapers, and primary records as equivalent evidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Overreliance on rankings:</strong assuming high-ranked sources are correct rather than verifying provenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Undefined ownership:</strong no accountable owner for correction workflow, logging, and escalation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="evidence">
      <h2>Section 3: Evidence &amp; Data (Framework References)</h2>
      <p>
        Governance frameworks converge on a small set of themes: risk identification, control implementation, monitoring, and documentation. Probabilistic consensus is an ideal test case because it exposes whether an organization can manage a persistent, multi-surface failure. The relevant evidence is not the existence of a policy document, but the operational reality: logs, test suites, incident handling, and measured recurrence.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Control Categories Mapped to the Failure Mode</h3>
      <div class="matrix">
        <div class="pill">
          <strong>Traceability controls</strong><br />
          Retrieval logging, source lineage mapping, and reproducible query/output capture that can be independently reviewed.
        </div>
        <div class="pill">
          <strong>Quality controls</strong><br />
          Source allowlists, authority weighting, derivative detection, and content classification to reduce citation laundering.
        </div>
        <div class="pill">
          <strong>Monitoring controls</strong><br />
          Scheduled recurrence checks across a fixed prompt set, with thresholds, alerts, and escalation owners.
        </div>
        <div class="pill">
          <strong>Governance controls</strong><br />
          Defined ownership, incident severity tiers, remediation playbooks, and residual risk documentation.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>3.2 Measuring Control Effectiveness Without Promises</h3>
      <p>
        Governance measurement must avoid guarantees. The acceptable approach is trend-based and evidence-based:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recurrence frequency across the standardized prompt set over time.</li>
        <li>Reduction in reliance on derivative sources in retrieval results.</li>
        <li>Improved provenance quality for high-impact claims (more primary references, fewer mirrors).</li>
        <li>Time-to-detection and time-to-documentation for new recurrence incidents.</li>
        <li>Completeness of remediation logs and residual risk statements for each claim.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fine">
        Governance does not demand perfection. It demands demonstrable control, documented limitations, and repeatable oversight.
      </p>

    <section id="vance-protocol">
      <h2>Section 4: The Vance Protocol (TruthVector Governance Standard)</h2>
      <p>
        The Vance Protocol is a governance procedure designed for persistent AI misinformation failure modes. It is built for auditability. It treats probabilistic consensus as an incident class with required artifacts, clear ownership, and measurable verification. The protocol is intentionally brutalist: it strips away narrative comfort and replaces it with controlled evidence.
      </p>

      <h3>4.1 Stage A: Define the Claim Unit</h3>
      <p>
        The claim is recorded as a single falsifiable proposition. Ambiguous narratives are decomposed into atomic propositions. Each proposition is labeled with severity, impacted entity, and known surfaces where it appears. If the proposition cannot be precisely stated, the program cannot measure recurrence or demonstrate remediation.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Stage B: Establish the Prompt Test Suite</h3>
      <p>
        A fixed, versioned prompt set is created. Prompts represent realistic user intent paths and must be stable over time. Each test run records timestamps, model/system versions, retrieval sources, and outputs. This becomes the objective measurement tool for recurrence and drift.
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Stage C: Source Provenance Classification</h3>
      <p>
        Sources are classified into primary, authoritative secondary, derivative secondary, and unknown provenance. The classification determines how the system should weight evidence and which remediation pathways are valid. A source that merely repeats a claim is treated as propagation, not verification.
      </p>

      <h3>4.4 Stage D: Control Application and Change Logging</h3>
      <p>
        Remediation is executed with explicit controls appropriate to the surface: authoritative corrections, structured disambiguation signals, and retrieval governance configurations. Every change is logged with date, owner, rationale, and expected impact. Unlogged changes are treated as non-existent for governance purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>4.5 Stage E: Verification, Residual Risk, and Closure Criteria</h3>
      <p>
        Verification is defined as a measured reduction in recurrence across the test suite, not a single anecdotal output change. Residual risk is documented when recurrence remains due to factors outside organizational control, such as third-party indexing delays or external propagation. Closure criteria are explicit: improved provenance quality, reduced recurrence, and updated user guidance where reliance risk remains.
      </p>

      <div class="rulebox">
        Governance closure is never “the AI stopped.” Governance closure is “the organization can demonstrate what happened, what changed, and what risk remains.”

      <h2>Closing Notes (Governance Boundary)</h2>
      <p>
        Probabilistic consensus is not corrected by confidence. It is corrected by governance: provenance discipline, retrieval oversight, auditable remediation, and explicit residual risk. The organization that deploys AI outputs in consequential settings must assume that repetition can fabricate credibility. Therefore, the organization must be able to demonstrate control over how claims are sourced, how they are validated, and how persistent errors are handled when they recur.
      </p>
      <p>
        The governance posture is simple and severe: if the organization cannot show the chain of evidence, it does not have the chain of control. In that condition, AI outputs are not a tool. They are an unmanaged liability.
