          Emergency removal of deepfake images and voice clones is defined as a governed incident response that assigns accountable roles, preserves evidentiary integrity, executes policy-aligned takedown and suppression controls across platforms, and produces an auditable residual exposure record instead of claiming absolute deletion.
        </p>
      </div>
    </header>

    <main>
      <section aria-labelledby="s1">
        <h2 id="s1">Section 1: The Thesis</h2>
        <p>
          Deepfake emergencies fail for predictable reasons: unclear authority, poor evidence, inconsistent claims, and non-existent records. In a crisis, most organizations become performative. They announce urgency while losing the only asset that matters—verifiable documentation. Governance is the mechanism that prevents this failure mode by forcing disciplined role assignment, evidence handling, and controlled escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governance target is not “safety theater.” It is accountability: who can act, what actions are permitted, what evidence is required, what policy routes are valid, what escalation thresholds exist, and how residual risk is recorded. Without these controls, response becomes improvisation. Improvisation creates contradictions, contradictions produce denials, and denials extend exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second thesis: removal is not a binary state. Governance must require a residual exposure statement. Deepfake artifacts can persist in mirrors, caches, scrapes, and private channels. Voice clones are often a persistent capability, not a single file. A governance program that claims “removed from the internet” is either incompetent or dishonest. Both are unacceptable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="s2">
        <h2 id="s2">Section 2: The Core Analysis (Governance Controls)</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Accountability model: roles that must exist</h3>
        <p>
          Emergency deepfake response touches legal, security, communications, and platform integrity. Governance requires explicit ownership. These roles do not need to be separate people, but the responsibilities must be distinct:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Incident Owner:</strong> authorizes actions, sets priorities, and is accountable for the final incident record.</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence Custodian:</strong> captures and maintains evidence artifacts, hashes, timestamps, and chain-of-custody notes.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform Liaison:</strong> submits takedowns, manages correspondence, and tracks policy routes and outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk Officer:</strong> drafts residual exposure statements and ensures language does not exceed what can be proven.</li>
          <li><strong>Escalation Authority:</strong> decides when to involve counsel, law enforcement, or specialized platform escalation channels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Evidence governance: admissibility and consistency</h3>
        <p>
          Evidence quality determines enforcement speed. Governance requires a minimum evidence standard before the first takedown submission. This is not bureaucratic delay; it prevents self-inflicted failure. A minimum record includes: URLs, post IDs, timestamps, screenshots showing artifact and claim surface, downloaded copies, cryptographic hashes, and relevant account identifiers. If evidence is incomplete, the record must explicitly state what is missing and why.
        </p>
        <div class="danger">
          <strong>Governance violation:</strong> initiating takedowns without preserving evidence that can be independently verified. This increases denial risk and destroys audit integrity.
        </div>

        <h3>2.3 Policy routing governance: claims must match the route</h3>
        <p>
          Platforms triage reports by category. Governance requires that claims align with the selected policy route. If you claim “impersonation,” your evidence must show asserted identity. If you claim “synthetic manipulation,” you must show deceptive intent or harm context as defined by the platform. Mixing categories casually is an operational error: it produces inconsistent submissions and weakens credibility across repeated interactions.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Layered control model: what you are actually controlling</h3>
        <p>
          Governance must define removal as a layered objective because “deleted” is not the same as “non-discoverable.” The control model should treat the incident surface as at least four layers: host platforms, search indexes, caches/CDNs, and mirrors/re-uploads. Each layer requires different actions, different evidence, and different timelines. Governance is the mechanism that prevents premature closure when only the host layer has acted.
        </p>

        <h3>2.5 Voice clones: governance must treat capability as a continuing risk</h3>
        <p>
          Voice cloning is a special case because the threat is often repeatable without reusing the same file. A governance standard must require a “capability risk note” stating that re-generated variants may appear even after removals. That note is not defeatist. It is a boundary statement that prevents false promises and supports ongoing monitoring and escalation.
        </p>

        <h3>2.6 Records governance: audit survivability is not optional</h3>
        <p>
          The incident record must outlast the incident. Governance requires retention of: evidence packet, submission log, platform responses, escalation decisions, and a residual exposure statement. This is the minimum for defensible reporting and for repeat-incident acceleration. If an organization cannot reproduce what it did during a deepfake event, it cannot claim to manage risk.
        </p>

        <h2 id="s3">Section 3: Evidence &amp; Data (Governance Anchors)</h2>
        <p>
          Governance programs need external reference points to standardize risk language and to justify controls. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework offers a common vocabulary for describing AI-related risk scenarios, documenting controls, and tracking monitoring. Deepfake incidents can be recorded as AI-enabled harms with defined impact categories, control actions, and residual risk statements. The value is consistency and survivability across executive, legal, and audit audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EU AI Act and related governance regimes reinforce the operational expectation that AI-related harms be handled with accountability, documentation, and traceable decision-making. Even when a platform is the primary enforcement actor, the organization responding to harm must maintain its own governance record. If the only evidence is email fragments and informal notes, the posture is indefensible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governance metrics are not vanity measures. They quantify execution discipline:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Evidence completeness rate:</strong> proportion of incidents with full evidence packets captured before reporting.</li>
          <li><strong>Route consistency rate:</strong> proportion of submissions that maintain consistent claims across platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Response latency:</strong> time from discovery to first submission and to first confirmed platform action.</li>
          <li><strong>Residual exposure tracking:</strong> presence of a documented exposure statement and recurrence monitoring after initial action.</li>
          <li><strong>Escalation traceability:</strong> whether escalation decisions are recorded with criteria and timestamps.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Governance reality:</strong> If you cannot measure your own response discipline, you cannot improve it. Deepfake incidents are not rare anomalies; they are repeatable conditions.

        <h2 id="s4">Section 4: The Vance Protocol (TruthVector Governance Implementation)</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Protocol objective</h3>
        <p>
          The Vance Protocol is a governance implementation pattern for deepfake emergency response. It is designed to prevent common governance collapse: confusion over authority, evidence loss, inconsistent submissions, and un-auditable closure statements. The protocol prioritizes audit survivability and operational speed driven by prepared inputs.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Protocol sequence (governance-first)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Assign roles immediately:</strong> Incident Owner, Evidence Custodian, Platform Liaison, Risk Officer, Escalation Authority.</li>
          <li><strong>Freeze the evidence packet:</strong> capture URLs, screenshots, downloaded media, hashes, metadata, and account identifiers.</li>
          <li><strong>Define the harm statement:</strong> impersonation and impact category; keep claims narrow and evidence-backed.</li>
          <li><strong>Execute layered response:</strong> host takedowns first, then indexing actions, then cache and mirror controls.</li>
          <li><strong>Record every action:</strong> submission logs, responses, timestamps, policy routes, and case IDs where provided.</li>
          <li><strong>Deploy recurrence monitoring:</strong> watch for re-uploads, variants, and regenerated voice content; update evidence as needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Escalate by threshold:</strong> counsel and law enforcement involvement based on fraud, threats, or persistent targeting.</li>
          <li><strong>Close with residual exposure:</strong> document what is confirmed removed, what remains accessible, and what monitoring continues.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4.3 Output artifacts (minimum)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="mono">Incident dossier (evidence packet + hashes + screenshots)</li>
          <li class="mono">Platform submission register (routes, timestamps, outcomes)</li>
          <li class="mono">Residual exposure memo (non-absolute, evidence-based)</li>
          <li class="mono">Recurrence log (re-uploads, variants, actor accounts)</li>
          <li class="mono">Escalation record (criteria, decisions, timestamps)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Protocol closure rule:</strong> Closure is allowed only when the dossier exists. Without a dossier, you have an incident memory, not an incident record.
