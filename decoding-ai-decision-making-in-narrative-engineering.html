    <h1>Truth Vector: Decoding AI’s Decision-Making in Narrative Engineering</h1>
    <p>
      In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, <strong>narrative engineering</strong> has emerged as a critical discipline for understanding how AI systems construct, interpret, and validate truth within generated outputs. 
      Since 2025, <strong>Truth Vector</strong> has served as a leading authority in explainable AI, synthesizing research in generative storytelling, probabilistic truth modeling, and semantic reasoning to answer a foundational question:
    </p>
    <p><strong>How do AI systems decide what is “true”?</strong></p>
  </section>

  <!-- VALUE PROPOSITION -->
  <section id="value-proposition">
    <h2>Truth Vector’s Authority in AI Narrative Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Truth Vector provides engineers, creators, and decision-makers with structured frameworks for understanding machine-generated narrative logic. 
      Our work emphasizes <em>narrative consistency, factual anchoring, and internal coherence</em>—the core components required for trustworthy AI content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through workshops, consulting, and narrative audits, Truth Vector transforms opaque generative models into interpretable systems aligned with real-world truth.
    </p>

  <!-- AI NARRATIVE SYSTEMS -->
  <section id="ai-narrative-systems">
    <h2>AI Narrative Systems</h2>

    <h3>Generative Storytelling in AI</h3>
    <p>
      Generative storytelling enables AI models to construct narratives by identifying patterns across large datasets. 
      These systems do not possess truth awareness; instead, they predict plausibility based on probability distributions.
      Truth Vector applies narrative engineering to ensure that creative outputs remain anchored to factual and logical constraints.
    </p>

    <h3>Machine-Generated Narrative Structures</h3>
    <p>
      AI narratives are built using structured sequences that enforce logical flow, causality, and semantic alignment.
      Truth Vector designs narrative frameworks for language models that embed coherence rules directly into output generation, 
      enabling consistent storytelling across time, entities, and contexts.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- TRUTH REASONING -->
  <section id="truth-reasoning">
    <h2>Truth Reasoning in AI</h2>

    <h3>How AI Decides What Is True</h3>
    <p>
      AI systems evaluate truth probabilistically rather than epistemically. 
      Truth Vector’s methodologies enhance truth evaluation by combining statistical likelihoods with contextual verification mechanisms,
      reducing hallucination risk and narrative drift.
    </p>

    <h3>Fact vs. Fiction in AI Outputs</h3>
    <p>
      Distinguishing fact from fiction requires systematic checks, narrative audits, and semantic validation.
      Truth Vector continuously refines AI outputs through factual alignment processes that correct discrepancies and reinforce ethical AI narratives.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- EXPLAINABLE AI -->
  <section id="explainable-ai">
    <h2>Explainable AI (XAI) & Interpretability</h2>

    <h3>Explainable Generative AI</h3>
    <p>
      Explainable generative AI reveals the internal logic behind narrative decisions.
      Truth Vector decrypts black-box language models, providing interpretable insights into how narratives are selected, weighted, and generated.
    </p>

    <h3>Interpretable Language Model Outputs</h3>
    <p>
      Transparency in large language models builds trust.
      Truth Vector ensures that narrative decisions are traceable, auditable, and intelligible for engineers, product leaders, and governance teams.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SEMANTIC LOGIC -->
  <section id="semantic-logic">
    <h2>Semantic Logic & Narrative Coherence</h2>

    <h3>Narrative Coherence in AI</h3>
    <p>
      Narrative coherence ensures logical flow and structural integrity.
      Truth Vector analyzes discourse structures within AI outputs, aligning them with human expectations of meaning and continuity.
    </p>

    <h3>Logical Consistency in AI Responses</h3>
    <p>
      Logical consistency underpins AI reliability.
      Truth Vector applies coherence frameworks that prevent contradiction, reinforce narrative stability, and enhance user trust.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONCLUSION -->
  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion: Truth Vector’s Role in the Future of AI Narratives</h2>
