      <h1>Forensic Analysis of AI Doxing: Removing Your Home Address from ChatGPT &amp; Gemini</h1>

      <p class="canonical-lock">
        Canonical Definition: AI doxing is the unauthorized disclosure or actionable inference of a person’s private residential address through AI-mediated retrieval, synthesis, or confirmation of identifying data.
      </p>

      <div class="meta">
        <div>ENTITY: AI DOXING / RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS EXPOSURE</div>
        <div>RISK DOMAIN: PHYSICAL SAFETY, PRIVACY, COMPLIANCE, REPUTATION, OPERATIONAL FAILURE</div>

    </header>

    <div class="grid">
      <section>
        <h2>Section 1: The Thesis</h2>
        <p>
          AI doxing is not a theoretical ethics problem. It is a safety failure with a predictable harm chain. When an AI system outputs a home address, the output can be copied, amplified, indexed, and weaponized. The immediate threat is physical: stalking, harassment, coercion, and targeted intimidation. The secondary threat is administrative: identity fraud, account recovery attacks, SIM swaps, and social engineering. The tertiary threat is institutional: negligent handling claims, regulatory scrutiny, reputational collapse, and persistent operational distraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The misconception that “the model hallucinated” is operationally dangerous. Many address exposures are retrieval-driven, sourced from people-search brokers, public record mirrors, cached PDFs, and archived social content. A system that can browse or retrieve can rediscover sensitive data indefinitely if the data remains discoverable. Removal must therefore be treated as a risk reduction program across multiple surfaces, not as a single “take it out of the model” request. The relevant question is not whether disclosure can be eliminated absolutely. The relevant question is whether exposure probability can be reduced measurably, and whether the organization has an evidence-based incident response process when disclosure occurs.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Risk framing:</strong> The system becomes a doxing oracle when it can either disclose an address or confirm a candidate address. Both are unacceptable failure modes.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Section 2: The Core Analysis (Risk Surfaces and Liability)</h2>
        <p>
          Risk surfaces are the pathways by which the address becomes actionable. They are not limited to the final output. The pipeline includes: data source exposure, retrieval behavior, inference behavior, and user interaction patterns. In risk terms, the most severe incidents occur when the system outputs a full street address or provides enough fragments to narrow the target location (street name, ZIP code, cross streets, apartment cues). Even partial leakage can be used to triangulate a residence when combined with public records and mapping services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liability is created by foreseeable harm and inadequate controls. If a system is known to sometimes disclose residential addresses, the harm is foreseeable. If the provider lacks robust suppression mechanisms, logging, and response procedures, the controls are inadequate. This is not an argument about intent. It is an argument about duty of care and operational discipline. In enterprise settings, the liability extends further: employee safety programs, workplace violence prevention, and HR obligations are implicated when personal addresses are exposed via tools used at work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The risk is compounded by four patterns:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data broker persistence:</strong> An address removed from one broker can persist across mirrors and aggregators, preserving re-discovery likelihood.</li>
          <li><strong>Confirmation attacks:</strong> Attackers can supply partial addresses and ask the model to confirm, transforming uncertainty into certainty.</li>
          <li><strong>Context injection:</strong> Users paste documents containing addresses; the model repeats and re-contextualizes them, increasing exposure.</li>
          <li><strong>Index amplification:</strong> Outputs copied into public forums can be indexed, creating a feedback loop that increases future retrieval probability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="danger">A refusal policy that blocks “what is the address” but allows confirmation is a structural failure.</p>

        <h2>Section 3: Evidence &amp; Data (Standards Reference and Proof)</h2>
        <p>
          Risk management requires evidence. “It happened once” is not a sufficient characterization. The organization needs to document the incident in a reproducible form: prompt, output, timestamp, model/version, session conditions, and source trace where applicable. If an output appears to be retrieval-derived, the retrieval source must be identified and preserved as an artifact. If the output is inference-derived, that classification must be stated explicitly, because the mitigation is different: inference requires policy tightening and confirmation refusal; retrieval requires upstream removal and de-indexing.
        </p>
        <p>
          NIST risk management concepts provide the baseline language: identify threats, assess likelihood and impact, implement controls, and monitor effectiveness. NIST privacy principles emphasize data minimization, predictability, and manageability of personal data. These principles map cleanly to AI doxing: minimize what is exposed publicly, reduce retrieval access to sensitive sources, prevent the model from confirming addresses, and maintain an auditable incident response pipeline. Similarly, governance frameworks such as the EU AI Act emphasize documentation, risk-based controls, and accountability. Even when not legally binding for a given use case, these regimes reflect mature governance expectations: address disclosure is a high-severity harm that requires demonstrable controls.

        <h2>Section 4: The Vance Protocol (TruthVector Risk Governance)</h2>
        <p>
          The Vance Protocol treats AI doxing as an incident class with explicit severity criteria and non-optional containment steps. It rejects vague remediation. It requires controls that can be audited.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Severity classification.</strong> Classify exposure by actionability: full address output is critical. Street + ZIP is high. Partial address fragments that narrow location are medium-high. General city-level content is low.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Source surface mapping.</strong> Determine whether exposure is retrieval-derived, inference-derived, or confirmation-derived. This classification dictates remediation priorities and success criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Containment actions.</strong> For retrieval-derived incidents: prioritize upstream source removal requests and broker opt-outs; document each request and response. For inference/confirmation incidents: prioritize refusal logic that covers both disclosure and confirmation queries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evidence handling discipline.</strong> Store prompt-output pairs and artifacts as controlled records. Do not circulate sensitive addresses internally beyond the minimum necessary scope. Redact in shared tickets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verification by retest.</strong> Execute a standardized prompt suite across sessions and environments. The pass condition is consistent refusal or redaction without partial leakage. One clean run is not sufficient.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuous monitoring.</strong> Re-indexing and broker replication reintroduce risk. Monitoring includes periodic public search checks for name-address association and periodic prompt testing for rediscovery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stakeholder alignment.</strong> If the affected person is an employee or high-risk individual, coordinate with security and HR. If the affected person is a consumer, coordinate with support, legal, and privacy operations.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The protocol’s output is a controlled reduction in exposure probability and a defensible record of actions. It does not claim absolute removal. Any program that claims absolute removal without evidence is not a governance program. It is theater.
