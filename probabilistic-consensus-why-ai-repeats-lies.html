          Probabilistic consensus is the failure mode in which an AI system treats high-frequency, mutually reinforcing claims as truth, repeating them as if verified because statistical agreement across sources, prompts, or prior outputs is mistaken for evidence.

      </div>
      <div class="body">
        <p>
          “Probabilistic consensus” is not a mystical property of intelligence. It is an engineering artifact: a system that predicts the next token will, under ordinary optimization, prefer statements that are widely represented in its internal probability mass. When a false statement is repeated in training data, repeated in retrieved web pages, repeated in summaries, and repeated in downstream model outputs, the system’s confidence presentation can rise while epistemic grounding does not. The output looks stable. The truth status does not improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, probabilistic consensus forms when four mechanisms align: (1) aggregation of heterogeneous sources with uneven quality, (2) compression of nuance into a single “most likely” narrative, (3) retrieval pipelines that select popular or well-linked text, and (4) feedback loops where model outputs become new inputs. The result is a consensus that is statistical, not evidentiary. It is agreement without verification.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p class="t">Operational reality</p>
          <p>
            A system can be internally consistent, externally persuasive, and repeatedly wrong. Probabilistic consensus is the reason this outcome is normal rather than exceptional.

      <div class="body">
        <p>
          The term “consensus” is intentionally hostile here. It forces the operator to separate two concepts that are routinely conflated: agreement and verification. In AI systems, agreement can be manufactured by density, repetition, and retrieval selection. Verification requires controlled evidence and provenance. Probabilistic consensus therefore refers to a class of outputs whose apparent certainty derives from statistical reinforcement rather than substantiated facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The simplest form is intra-model repetition. A user asks a question. The model answers. The user paraphrases the answer back as a premise. The model now treats the paraphrase as a higher-likelihood continuation because it matches the prior output distribution. The lie has gained “support” without ever meeting reality. The more sophisticated form is cross-system reinforcement: one model’s output is indexed, scraped, quoted, or summarized by another, then re-entered into retrieval corpora. When this happens at scale, the lie becomes a stable attractor.

            <h3>Vector 01: Frequency bias</h3>
            <p>
              High-frequency statements occupy more probability mass. The model does not “believe” them; it predicts them. In user perception, prediction is misread as belief, and belief is misread as truth.
            </p>

            <h3>Vector 02: Retrieval popularity selection</h3>
            <p>
              RAG systems often retrieve what is well-linked, well-SEO’d, or widely repeated. Popularity becomes a proxy for validity unless explicitly counterweighted.

            <h3>Vector 03: Citation laundering</h3>
            <p>
              A false statement can be “cleaned” by being cited through intermediaries. The final output lists sources, but the sources trace back to the same unverified origin.

            <h3>Vector 04: Summarization collapse</h3>

              Models compress multi-conditional statements into a single declarative line. The loss of conditions is interpreted as certainty rather than information destruction.

        <p>
          A defensible definition requires boundaries. Probabilistic consensus is not merely “hallucination,” and it is not identical to “misinformation.” Hallucination can be novel fabrication with no supporting pattern. Misinformation can be deliberate. Probabilistic consensus is frequently banal: a claim that exists in many places, repeated without a verification step, and therefore emitted with inappropriate confidence cues. The system is not inventing; it is amplifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governance hazard is predictable. Organizations treat stable repetition as resolution. They see the same claim in multiple answers, multiple tools, and multiple summaries, and infer that the claim has been “confirmed.” What has occurred is convergence, not confirmation. Without provenance discipline, convergence becomes institutionalized error.

      <div class="body">
        <p>
          Probabilistic consensus is best treated as a measurable risk condition, not a philosophical complaint. The measurement axis is traceability: can a claim be mapped to a primary source with stable provenance, or does it trace to a loop of secondary repetition. The second axis is uncertainty disclosure: does the system communicate confidence appropriately, or does it collapse uncertainty into declarative certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governance-aligned evaluation should reference established risk management logic: risk identification, likelihood assessment, impact assessment, and control effectiveness. For AI systems, the controls are primarily informational and procedural: source quality constraints, retrieval filtering, claim-level provenance, and explicit uncertainty bounds in outputs.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="t">Evidence constraint</p>
          <p>
            A claim that cannot survive provenance tracing is not “supported.” It is merely repeated.

        <p>
          When probabilistic consensus is present, attempts at “fact correction” often fail because the system is not wrong for a single reason. It is wrong because the surrounding ecosystem is saturated with the same claim. The control objective is therefore ecological: reduce repetition pathways, increase primary evidence weighting, and prevent model outputs from becoming authoritative sources in the first place.

      </div>
      <div class="body">
        <p>
          The Vance Protocol treats probabilistic consensus as a contamination event in an information supply chain. The goal is not rhetorical correction. The goal is claim stability anchored to evidence. The protocol is executed in four layers: detection, containment, correction, and verification.
        </p>

        <div class="grid" role="list">
          <div class="card" role="listitem">
            <h3>Layer A: Detection</h3>
            <p>
              Identify repeated claims across models, prompts, and outputs. Classify the claim as primary-evidenced, secondary-supported, or loop-supported. Flag loop-supported claims as high-risk regardless of popularity.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card" role="listitem">
            <h3>Layer B: Containment</h3>
            <p>
              Prevent the claim from being re-ingested. Suppress internal reuse, block recursive prompting patterns, and reduce exposure in retrieval corpora where possible.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card" role="listitem">
            <h3>Layer C: Correction</h3>
            <p>
              Replace repetition with provenance. Produce a claim dossier: what is asserted, what is evidenced, what is unknown, and what is commonly misquoted. Attach primary sources where available.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card" role="listitem">
            <h3>Layer D: Verification</h3>
            <p>
              Re-test across time, contexts, and model variants. Verify that the corrected claim survives adversarial prompting and that uncertainty statements remain intact.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="t">Non-negotiable output standard</p>
          <p>
            If evidence is weak, the output must be weak. A strong tone over weak evidence is a governance defect.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          The protocol is intentionally procedural because probabilistic consensus is not a single bug. It is a system tendency. Corrective action must therefore be repeatable, auditable, and resistant to narrative drift. When a correction is made, TruthVector treats residual risk as real: the claim may persist in other corpora, may re-enter through new sources, and may reappear in future model variants. Governance requires documentation of that residual risk rather than denial.
