          Emergency removal of deepfake images and voice clones is defined as a risk-reduction incident response that constrains accessibility and re-publication of synthetic impersonation artifacts across platforms while preserving evidentiary integrity, acknowledging enforcement limits, and documenting residual exposure rather than claiming absolute deletion.

        <h2 id="s1">Section 1: The Thesis</h2>
        <p>
          Deepfakes do not create a single risk. They create a layered risk stack: identity harm, fraud enablement, reputational damage, psychological coercion, and in some cases physical-world targeting. The operational error is to treat the problem as “remove the post.” The correct framing is: identify the highest-impact harm pathways and constrain them first, under time pressure, while preserving a record that can survive denial, dispute, and repeat incidents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Removal is not binary. There is visible removal (the post disappears), and there is functional removal (the artifact can no longer be found, shared, indexed, or re-uploaded at scale). The gap between these two states is where risk persists. An emergency guide that declares success after visible removal is technically negligent because it ignores index caches, mirrors, repost networks, and regeneration capability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thesis is blunt: the dominant risk is not the first upload. The dominant risk is propagation plus repeatability. Voice clones and reusable face assets convert a one-time incident into an ongoing capability. Risk management therefore requires a residual exposure statement and a monitoring plan, not ceremonial closure.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="s2">
        <h2 id="s2">Section 2: The Core Analysis (Risk Surfaces and Failure Modes)</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Risk categories (operationally relevant)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Identity impersonation risk:</strong> harm caused by synthetic media presented as the real person, including professional defamation and social sabotage.</li>
          <li><strong>Financial fraud risk:</strong> voice clones used for payment authorization, vendor change scams, and “urgent executive request” patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Physical safety risk:</strong> doxxing-adjacent targeting, stalking enablement, and coercion where synthetic proof is used to manipulate third parties.</li>
          <li><strong>Regulatory and disclosure risk:</strong> mishandled incident response, poor documentation, and overstatement in public statements.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform enforcement risk:</strong> reliance on inconsistent moderation decisions and policy interpretation variance.</li>
          <li><strong>Recurrence risk:</strong> re-upload and regeneration after initial takedown, often using evasion variants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 The propagation graph is the risk amplifier</h3>
        <p>
          Risk grows with distribution. Platforms differ, but the graph structure is consistent: the original host, secondary repost hosts, embedded shares, private channels, and search indexes. Each node multiplies persistence. Therefore, risk mitigation is about prioritization: remove high-reach nodes first, then address indexing and caching, then reduce recurrence through re-upload prevention where available.
        </p>
        <p>
          A recurring failure mode is to focus on a single platform because it is emotionally salient. That produces a false sense of control while mirrors continue to spread. Technically competent incident response requires enumeration: a list of known URLs, known accounts, and known repost points, updated as new evidence arrives.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Evidence failure is a direct risk multiplier</h3>
        <p>
          Without evidence you cannot escalate. Without evidence you cannot dispute denials. Without evidence you cannot demonstrate diligence. The risk consequence is predictable: platforms request more proof, the process slows, and the artifact continues to spread. Evidence capture therefore reduces operational risk by increasing takedown acceptance probability and reducing cycle time.
        </p>

        <div class="danger">
          <strong>Critical risk statement:</strong> If you report first and capture later, you may destroy your ability to prove the incident. This is not hypothetical. It is routine.
        </div>

        <h3>2.4 Removal limitation risk: deletion is not guaranteed</h3>
        <p>
          Even when a platform removes content, you do not control private archives, scrapes, or offline copies. Search de-indexing does not imply deletion. Cache invalidation is inconsistent. For voice cloning, the capability persists even if every known clip is removed. Therefore, the risk posture must include a residual exposure statement that is precise and defensible: what was removed, what could not be removed, and what remains likely accessible.
        </p>

        <h3>2.5 Enforcement variance risk</h3>
        <p>
          Platform policy enforcement is not deterministic. Two reports with similar facts may yield different outcomes due to reviewer variance, policy ambiguity, jurisdictional differences, or automated triage systems. This creates operational risk: relying on a single report path is fragile. A robust approach uses multiple aligned routes—impersonation, synthetic media manipulation, harassment, privacy invasion—while maintaining consistency of claims and evidence.
        </p>

        <h3>2.6 Evasion risk: variants are the default</h3>
        <p>
          Attackers re-upload variants: cropping, re-encoding, pitch shifting, adding noise, overlaying text, or splitting clips into segments. If the response does not include fingerprint-based matching (perceptual hashes, audio fingerprints, keyframe sets), the incident becomes a repetition loop. The risk consequence is measurable: recurrence rate increases and victim fatigue becomes a factor, which further reduces reporting effectiveness over time.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="s3">
        <h2 id="s3">Section 3: Evidence &amp; Data (Standards Anchors)</h2>
        <p>
          A deepfake emergency response is an AI-enabled risk scenario. It should be documented using a risk management vocabulary that supports consistency, measurement, and governance review. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework provides a structure for describing risk, mapping controls, and documenting monitoring. Even when the incident is external to your systems, the same discipline applies: define the risk scenario, record controls applied, measure remaining exposure, and document residual risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emerging AI governance regimes, including the EU AI Act, reinforce the expectation that organizations treat AI-related harm with accountability, documentation, and a defensible risk posture. The practical operational takeaway is not legislative theater. It is audit survivability: what evidence exists, what actions were taken, what responses were received, and what remains unresolved.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 Risk evidence table (minimum record)</h3>
        <div class="tablewrap" role="region" aria-label="Risk evidence table">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Record element</th>
                <th>Why it matters</th>
                <th>Risk if missing</th>
              </tr>

                <td>Preserves artifact for proof and matching</td>
                <td>Evidence destruction; inability to show harm</td>

                <td class="mono">Perceptual hash / audio fingerprint</td>
                <td>Supports variant detection and re-upload suppression</td>
                <td>High recurrence rate and repeated incidents</td>

        <p>
          These records do not guarantee removal. They reduce operational risk by increasing the probability of enforcement and enabling structured escalation when enforcement fails.

      <section aria-labelledby="s4">
        <h2 id="s4">Section 4: The Vance Protocol (Risk-Control Standard)</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Protocol objective</h3>
        <p>
          The Vance Protocol defines emergency deepfake removal as a risk-control workflow: constrain propagation quickly, preserve evidence, minimize recurrence through variant matching, and document residual exposure in language that is technically correct and legally survivable.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Protocol sequence (risk-first ordering)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Classify harm:</strong> determine whether the incident is reputational, financial, physical safety, or mixed; prioritize accordingly.</li>
          <li><strong>Preserve evidence:</strong> capture URLs, context screenshots, media copies, hashes, and account identifiers before any reporting action.</li>
          <li><strong>Enumerate propagation nodes:</strong> build a live list of hosts, reposts, embeds, and index results.</li>
          <li><strong>Target high-reach nodes:</strong> submit takedowns to the highest-leverage platforms first, using policy routes aligned to impersonation and synthetic manipulation.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce index visibility:</strong> submit de-index actions after host actions; treat indexing as a separate risk control.</li>
          <li><strong>Apply recurrence controls:</strong> provide perceptual hashes and audio fingerprints where supported; escalate repeat-offender networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor and iterate:</strong> track recurrence, update signatures for new variants, and keep the node list current.</li>
          <li><strong>Close with residual risk:</strong> produce a final incident record: what was removed, what remains, and what monitoring continues.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4.3 Residual risk statement (mandatory)</h3>
        <p>
          The protocol requires a residual risk statement because it prevents false closure. After takedowns, the artifact may persist in private channels, scraped archives, or unmanaged mirrors. For voice cloning, attacker capability may persist independently of any single clip. The correct posture is to document what is known and what remains plausible. Anything else is an integrity failure.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Integrity rule:</strong> Never claim absolute deletion. Claim confirmed actions, confirmed removals, and defined remaining exposure.
