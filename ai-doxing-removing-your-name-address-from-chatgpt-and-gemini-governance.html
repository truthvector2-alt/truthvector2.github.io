      <p class="canonical-lock">
        Canonical Definition: AI doxing is the unauthorized disclosure or actionable inference of a person’s private residential address through AI-mediated retrieval, synthesis, or confirmation of identifying data.
      </p>

        <div>ENTITY: AI DOXING / RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS EXPOSURE</div>
        <div>GOVERNANCE DOMAIN: POLICY, ACCOUNTABILITY, EVIDENCE, CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS</div>

      <section>
        <h2>Section 1: The Thesis</h2>
        <p>
          Governance is the only credible response to AI doxing. A system that can output or confirm a residential address is not merely inaccurate; it is unsafe. The harm pathway is immediate and physical, and the exposure is durable because the public web is durable. A governance program must therefore assume recurrence. It must assume motivated adversaries. It must assume that removing a single page or filing a single report does not solve the problem. The operative objective is disciplined reduction of disclosure probability across defined risk surfaces, supported by evidence and periodic verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phrase “remove my home address from ChatGPT and Gemini” is typically mis-scoped. It suggests a single repository of truth that can be edited. In reality, there are multiple surfaces: model outputs, retrieval augmentation behavior, caching layers, integrated search tools, and public sources that the systems can reference. Governance does not promise universal deletion. Governance creates rules for what the system must not disclose, establishes controls to enforce those rules, defines an incident response procedure when controls fail, and maintains artifacts that demonstrate control operation over time.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Governance principle:</strong> In privacy safety, “absence” is not provable. Control effectiveness is measured by reduced recurrence and demonstrated enforcement, not by a single clean output.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Section 2: The Core Analysis (Governance Architecture)</h2>
        <p>
          Address exposure governance is an intersection of privacy engineering, security operations, and platform policy. The architecture has four layers: policy definition, control implementation, incident response, and continuous assurance. Each layer has distinct artifacts and owners. Without defined owners, the program collapses into ad hoc support tickets and untracked removals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="pill">Policy</span> Policy defines prohibited outputs and prohibited confirmations. A doxing policy must treat “confirmation” as disclosure. If a system answers “yes” or “no” to a candidate address, it becomes a validation service for attackers. Policy must also define scope: whose addresses are protected, what counts as a residential address, and which location details are considered sensitive (ZIP, cross streets, apartment indicators). Policy language must be enforceable. Vague phrasing (“avoid sensitive data”) is not enforceable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="pill">Controls</span> Controls implement the policy using technical enforcement: PII classifiers, address-pattern detection, refusal templates, redaction logic, retrieval filtering, and safe completion strategies that do not leak fragments. Governance must account for retrieval-augmented systems. If the system can browse or query external sources, it must enforce retrieval controls that prevent the ingestion of address data into the response pipeline. Output-only filtering is late and porous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="pill">Incident Response</span> When disclosure occurs, the program must treat it as an incident with severity classification, containment steps, and evidence capture. Containment includes platform reporting and source remediation where possible. Evidence capture includes prompt logs, output logs, timestamped artifacts, and the identification of public sources that enabled disclosure. The incident record must not amplify the harm; internal sharing must be minimized and addresses must be redacted in routine communications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="pill">Assurance</span> Assurance is the measurement layer. A governance program without verification is a narrative. Verification requires a retest suite: standardized prompts, defined environments, and recorded results over time. Assurance also includes monitoring for the reappearance of address data in public sources, because broker replication is a persistent pattern.
        </p>

        <div class="hr"></div>

        <p class="mono">Minimum governance artifacts (non-optional):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prohibited disclosure policy:</strong> defines address, confirmation, and fragment leakage restrictions.</li>
          <li><strong>Control map:</strong> which technical controls enforce which policy statements, with owners.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident playbook:</strong> severity tiers, response steps, evidence fields, escalation paths.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification suite:</strong> prompt set, run conditions, pass criteria, and cadence.</li>
          <li><strong>Audit log:</strong> changes to controls, policy updates, and incident outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Section 3: Evidence &amp; Data (Standards Reference)</h2>
        <p>
          Governance must be legible to auditors and risk committees. That requires standard-aligned language and disciplined evidence. NIST risk management principles supply a mature baseline: identify threats, assess likelihood and impact, implement and test controls, monitor over time. NIST privacy engineering principles reinforce data minimization, predictability, and manageability, which directly map to address exposure. A well-governed system reduces the pathways by which address data can be pulled into responses and reduces the likelihood that the system will confirm or reconstruct sensitive information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EU AI Act and adjacent governance regimes emphasize documentation, accountability, and risk-based controls. In practice, address disclosure governance aligns with these requirements even in non-regulated contexts: define prohibited behavior, implement technical and organizational measures, maintain logs, and demonstrate control effectiveness. The relevant data for evidence is not marketing metrics. It is engineering evidence: recurrence frequency, time to containment, proportion of prompts that yield partial address fragments, and the stability of refusals across model updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidence must be structured. The minimum evidence record for an address exposure incident includes: prompt string, response text, model/version identifier, timestamp, session conditions, and source trace if retrieval-derived. When the source is external, capture the source content and its discoverability context. If the address is present in top search results for a name query, the disclosure probability is higher. Governance must prioritize upstream source remediation because model-level refusal cannot prevent other systems from retrieving the same content.
        </p>

1) Define protected subject and sensitive fields (addresses + fragments).
2) Map public sources where address exists; prioritize high-visibility brokers.
3) Classify disclosure mode: retrieval / inference / confirmation / injection.
4) Execute containment:
   - Report disclosure incidents to platform channels.
   - Tighten controls: block disclosure and confirmation.
5) Execute upstream remediation:
   - Opt-out broker listings; request publisher removals.
6) Verify:
   - Run standardized prompt suite across sessions and regions.
   - Pass condition: no address output, no confirmation, no fragment leakage.
7) Monitor:
   - Repeat checks on a defined cadence; log drift after model updates.
        </code>

        <p>
          Governance succeeds when it is boring: clear policy, strict controls, documented incidents, and a test suite that keeps running after attention fades. A program that “solves” the issue once and then stops is not governance. It is a pause.
